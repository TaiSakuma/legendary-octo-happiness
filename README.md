# legendary-octo-happiness

A reference implementation for automated changelog and release workflows using Conventional Commits.

## Motivation

This repo solves a chain of problems that come up when trying to automate releases for GitHub projects:

- **Inconsistent commit history** — Without enforcement, commit messages are useless for automation.
- **Manual changelogs** — Tedious and error-prone. With structured commits, [git-cliff](https://git-cliff.org/) can generate them.
- **Manual releases** — Creating GitHub Releases by hand is repetitive.
- **Force-tagging** — Tagging *before* generating the changelog means the tag misses the changelog commit, requiring a force-update.
- **`GITHUB_TOKEN` limitation** — Tags pushed by `GITHUB_TOKEN` [don't trigger `on: push` workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#using-the-github_token-in-a-workflow), breaking naive tag-based release chains.

This repo addresses all of these with a two-tag pipeline and `workflow_run` chaining.

## How it works

### PR merge flow

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[PR opened] --> B{Title follows\nConventional Commits?}
    B -- No --> C[CI blocks merge]
    B -- Yes --> D[Squash merge]
    D --> E[Clean conventional\ncommit on main]
```

Squash merging makes the PR title the commit message, guaranteeing a clean, parseable history.

### Release flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Dev as Developer
    participant GH as GitHub Actions

    Dev->>Dev: hatch version <rule>
    Dev->>GH: push commit + u-tag

    Note over GH: Changelog workflow (on push: tags: u*)
    GH->>GH: Generate CHANGELOG.md
    GH->>GH: Commit to main
    GH->>GH: Create v-tag on changelog commit
    GH->>GH: Push main + v-tag

    Note over GH: Release workflow (on workflow_run)
    GH->>GH: Create GitHub Release for v-tag
```

The result on `main`:

```text
... feature commits ...
commit A  (version bump)      ← u1.1.0
commit B  (update CHANGELOG)  ← v1.1.0   ← GitHub Release
```

The `v` tag always includes the updated changelog — no force-tagging needed.

## Setting up from scratch

How to replicate this setup in a new repository. Each step references the actual file in this repo.

### 1. Repository settings

In your GitHub repo settings:

- **Allow only squash merges** (disable merge commits and rebase merges)
- **Enable auto-delete head branches**

These ensure every commit on `main` comes from a squash merge with the PR title as the message.

> **Note:** This is a manual step — it can't be configured via code.

### 2. PR title enforcement

Add [`amannn/action-semantic-pull-request`](https://github.com/amannn/action-semantic-pull-request) to validate PR titles against Conventional Commits, and a PR template to remind contributors of the convention.

See: [`.github/workflows/pr-title.yml`](.github/workflows/pr-title.yml), [`.github/pull_request_template.md`](.github/pull_request_template.md)

### 3. Automatic PR labels

Label PRs based on their Conventional Commits prefix. These labels feed into GitHub's auto-generated release notes categories.

See: [`.github/workflows/conventional-label.yml`](.github/workflows/conventional-label.yml), [`.github/release.yml`](.github/release.yml)

### 4. Version management

Use [`hatch-regex-commit`](https://github.com/frankie567/hatch-regex-commit) so `hatch version <rule>` bumps the version, creates a commit, and tags it.

1. Add `hatch-regex-commit` to build requires in `pyproject.toml`:

   ```toml
   [build-system]
   requires = ["hatchling", "hatch-regex-commit"]
   ```

2. Create a version file (e.g., [`src/legendary_octo_happiness/__about__.py`](src/legendary_octo_happiness/__about__.py)):

   ```python
   __version__ = "0.1.0"
   ```

3. Configure `[tool.hatch.version]` to use the `u` tag prefix:

   ```toml
   [tool.hatch.version]
   source = "regex_commit"
   path = "src/legendary_octo_happiness/__about__.py"
   tag_name = "u{new_version}"
   tag_sign = false
   ```

4. Mark the version as dynamic in `[project]`:

   ```toml
   dynamic = ["version"]
   ```

See: [`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml)

### 5. Changelog generation

Add a changelog workflow that triggers on `u` tags. This repo uses a composite action ([`changelog-commit`](.github/actions/changelog-commit/action.yml)) that bundles a [git-cliff config](.github/actions/changelog-commit/cliff.toml) and all the logic needed to:

1. Check out `main` with full history
2. Verify the tag is on `main`
3. Run git-cliff to generate `CHANGELOG.md`
4. Commit the changelog, create the `v` tag, and push both

See: [`.github/actions/changelog-commit/action.yml`](.github/actions/changelog-commit/action.yml), [`.github/workflows/changelog.yml`](.github/workflows/changelog.yml)

### 6. Automated releases

Add a release workflow that triggers via `workflow_run` after the Changelog workflow completes. This repo uses a composite action ([`checkout-version-tag`](.github/actions/checkout-version-tag/action.yml)) to derive the `v` tag from the `u` tag that triggered the Changelog workflow.

This sidesteps the `GITHUB_TOKEN` limitation: instead of triggering on `push: tags: v*` (which won't fire for tags pushed by `GITHUB_TOKEN`), the workflow listens for the Changelog workflow's completion.

See: [`.github/actions/checkout-version-tag/action.yml`](.github/actions/checkout-version-tag/action.yml), [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml)

### 7. Claude Code

Add a [`.claude/CLAUDE.md`](.claude/CLAUDE.md) file with project guidance so [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) understands the build commands, PR conventions, and release flow.

## Composite actions

The changelog and release workflows delegate to two reusable composite actions under [`.github/actions/`](.github/actions/).

### `changelog-commit`

Generates a changelog with git-cliff, commits it, creates a release tag, and pushes both to the target branch.

| Input | Default | Description |
| ----- | ------- | ----------- |
| `trigger-tag` | *(required)* | Tag that triggered the workflow (e.g., `u1.2.3`) |
| `trigger-tag-prefix` | `u` | Prefix to strip from the trigger tag |
| `release-tag-prefix` | `v` | Prefix for the release tag |
| `branch` | `main` | Branch to verify against, commit to, and push |
| `changelog-path` | `CHANGELOG.md` | Path to the changelog file |
| `commit-parsers` | *(built-in)* | TOML array of commit parsers to override the defaults |
| `body` | *(built-in)* | Tera template for the changelog body |

| Output | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `release-tag` | Computed release tag (e.g., `v1.2.3`) |
| `version` | Bare version number (e.g., `1.2.3`) |
| `changed` | `'true'` or `'false'` — whether the changelog was updated |

### `checkout-version-tag`

Derives a release tag from a trigger tag, then checks out that ref.

| Input | Default | Description |
| ----- | ------- | ----------- |
| `trigger-tag` | *(required)* | Tag/branch name to derive from (e.g., `u1.2.3`) |
| `trigger-tag-prefix` | `u` | Prefix to strip from the trigger tag |
| `release-tag-prefix` | `v` | Prefix for the release tag |
| `fetch-depth` | `1` | Number of commits to fetch |

| Output | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `release-tag` | Computed release tag (e.g., `v1.2.3`) |
| `version` | Bare version number (e.g., `1.2.3`) |

## Pitfalls

Problems encountered during setup, with solutions.

### Tera macros in git-cliff templates

Using `macro` definitions in the cliff.toml body template causes `Function not found` errors. git-cliff's Tera environment doesn't support custom macros in the body context. **Solution:** Inline the URL directly in the template. See [#7](https://github.com/iris-hep/legendary-octo-happiness/pull/7).

### `GITHUB_TOKEN` tags don't trigger workflows

Tags pushed by `GITHUB_TOKEN` don't fire `on: push: tags` events. **Solution:** Use `workflow_run` chaining — the Release workflow triggers when the Changelog workflow completes, not on tag push.

### Tag push events have no branch context

You can't use a `branches` filter with `on: push: tags` — GitHub doesn't provide branch context for tag events. **Solution:** Add an explicit verification step in the workflow that checks whether the tag's commit is an ancestor of `main`.

### `commit_preprocessors` don't support env var expansion

git-cliff's `commit_preprocessors` use `${N}` syntax for regex capture groups only. Environment variables like `${GITHUB_REPO}` in a `replace` field resolve to empty strings — they are not expanded. **Solution:** Use git-cliff's GitHub integration instead: pass `GITHUB_TOKEN` so git-cliff can fetch PR metadata via the API, then render PR links in the body template using `commit.remote.pr_number` and the `remote.github.owner`/`remote.github.repo` Tera variables.

### `hatch-regex-commit` needs a file path

The `path` in `[tool.hatch.version]` must point to a Python file like `__about__.py`, not `pyproject.toml`. The version field in `[project]` must be `dynamic`.
